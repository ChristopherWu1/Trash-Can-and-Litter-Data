        <h3> Analyzing the effects of Trash Cans on Litter Complaints in New York City </h3>
        <p> New York City has a littering problem and very little is done to combat it. The city has had solutions, but they act more as a band-aid as opposed to a permanent solution.
             One solution would be to add more trash cans throughout the city where litter complaints are high.</p>

            The first graph shows the total amount of trash cans and litter complaints group by the five boroughs. 
            Three of the boroughs have the amount of complaints exceed the amount of trash cans : Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.
