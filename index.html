        <h1> <u> Litter and Trash Cans  </u></h1>
        <h3> Analyzing the effects of Trash Cans on Litter Complaints in New York City </h3>
        <p> New York City has a littering problem and very little is done to combat it. The city has had solutions, but they act more as a band-aid as opposed to a permanent solution.
             One solution would be to add more trash cans throughout the city where litter complaints are high.</p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
            Residents of New York City can call 311 to report any complaint they have. The city then uploads these 311 complaints to openNYC, where anyone can access the data for free. 
            I filtered out the data to only include complaints about litter. I then counted the number of times a certain complaint type appears and put the data into a bar graph. 
            The complaint that appears the most is a request for a new litter basket. People believe that there should be more litter baskets around the city for convenience. In some areas of the city, 
            pedestrians would have to walk for blocks to look for a place to throw out their trash, making them more likely to litter. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The second complaint that appears the most is an existing litter bin overflowing from trash. The collection of trash from these bins are done by the Department of Sanitation, or the DSNY. 
            Cleaning out the bins are not prioritized by the DSNY, so the trash piles up in the bins. Overflowing bins also contributes to the litter problem, as the wind and animals carry the trash away from the bin
            and onto the streets.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first graph shows the total amount of trash cans and litter complaints group by the five boroughs. 
            Four of the boroughs have the amount of complaints exceed the amount of trash cans : Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.  In some boroughs, there are more than 2 complaints to every bin. 
            Only Manhattan has a higher bin count than complaints. They also have the most amounts of bins in the city. This brings up some interesting questions about the need of the bins. Are the amount of bins in Manhattan required since the amount of complaints are low?
            Is the low amount of complaints because of the high amounts of bins?

        <p>
            I also decided to compared the population of each borough to the amount of litter bins and complaints in each borough.
