            <h1> <u> Litter and Trash Cans  </u></h1>
            <h3> Analyzing the effects of Trash Cans on Litter Complaints in New York City </h3>
        </div>
        <p> 
            New York City has a littering problem and very little is done to combat it. Trash is always on the sidewalks and litter baskets are always full. The city has had solutions, but they act more as a band-aid as opposed to a permanent solution.
            One solution they came up with is the City Cleanup Corps, where they hire people to pick up trash from the streets. I think this solution is inefficent and a better one can be used.
            
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            One solution would be to add more trash cans throughout the city where litter complaints are high. All the city has to do is place these trash cans around the city and have the DSNY clean it out. 
            The city provides various kinds data about litter, such as litter complaints and locations of litter baskets. 
            The Department of Sanitiation, or DSNY is the department responsible for the litter baskets and trash cleanup.
            Residents of New York City can call 311 to report any complaint they have.  The city then uploads these 311 complaints to openNYC, where anyone can access the data for free.
            I used python and various python libraries to load, manipulate, and visualize the data.
        </p>

        <p>
            
            I filtered out 311 complaints to only include complaints about litter. I then counted the number of times a certain complaint type appears and put the data into a bar graph. 
            The complaint that appears the most is a request for a new litter basket. People believe that there should be more litter baskets around the city for convenience. In some areas of the city, 
            pedestrians would have to walk for blocks to look for a place to throw out their trash, making them more likely to litter. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The second complaint that appears the most is an existing litter bin overflowing from trash. The collection of trash from these bins are done by the Department of Sanitation, or the DSNY. 
            Cleaning out the bins are not prioritized by the DSNY, so the trash piles up in the bins. Overflowing bins also contributes to the litter problem, as the wind and animals carry the trash away from the bin
            and onto the streets. People are also less likely to throw their trash into the bins if they see it full and they are more likely litter on the streets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third complaint is a general litter basket complaint, described by the DSNY as a basket being used for household or commercial waste. I decided not to include it in my data as it 
            has no relation to litter.
        </p>
        <br />

        <img src="images/cans_vs_litter_by_borough.png" alt="Bar graph that compares the amount of cans to amount of litter reports by borough" width="960" height="720">
        <p>
            This graph shows the total amount of trash cans and litter complaints group by the five boroughs. 
            Four of the boroughs have the amount of complaints exceed the amount of trash cans : Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.  In some boroughs, there are more than 2 complaints to every bin. 
            Only Manhattan has a higher bin count than complaints. They also have the most amounts of bins in the city. This brings up some interesting questions about the need of the bins. Are the amount of bins in Manhattan required since the amount of complaints are low?
            Is the low amount of complaints because of the high amounts of bins?

        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/population_vs_cans_litter_by_borough.png" alt="Bar graph that compares the amount of cans to the population by borough" width="960" height="720">
        <p>
            I also decided to compared the population of each borough to the amount of litter bins and complaints in each borough. It is a better representative of the data since boroughs 
            like Brooklyn and Queens have a higher population than the rest of the boroughs, so they are going to have more complaints. Looking at the map, all the boroughs except Manhattan has a high
            people to bin ratio, around 900 people per bin. Manhattan has a much lower people to bin ratio, but it has a lower amount of residents compared to other boroughs. Brooklyn has one of the best ratios in both
            categories with only about 800 people per bin and less than 400 people per complaint. I think every borough should strive to have these kinds of ratios. Queens have over 1,000 people per bin, that is way too high to be effective enough to reduce litter.

        <p>
            This interactive map has three different layers to it. The first layer being the amount of bins in each DSNY district. The department of sanitation breaks the city into 7 operating zones and further breaks those zones into districts.
            I then mapped out how many bins are in each district throughout the city with a color gradient. The darker green means it has the most amount of bins and the light yellow districts have the least amount of bins. In the zones with a small amount of bins, there are ma lot of requests for new bins. However,
            in many places where there is currently a bin, that area has a history of repeating requests for a bin in the past and the city putting a trash bin there. Some of the bins are there because of the feedback given by residents. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Some bins are going through a cycle of the city neglecting them and the bins overflowing, then the city removes the bin because they cannot properly maintain them, and the residents of the neighborhood complain that the bin is missing.
            Take the image below as an example. Located at the intersection of 95'th street and 37'th avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens. This one intersection has had 24 complaints, most of it coming between 2018 and 2019.
        </p>
        <iframe src = 'maps/small.html' width="960" height="720" > </iframe>
        <p>
            The first complaint came in 2010, asking for a litter basket at this location. There was only one more complaint in 2014, an overflowing complaint,so that means the city did put a trash can there. Starting in 2018 is where the main bulk of the complaints at this location
            came from. It first started on September 15'th, 2018, where a resident sent a overflowing basket complaint. The next complaint happened a month later, a new basket request. The city must have decided that the bin was too hard to maintain, so they removed it. This then lead to
            more complaints for a new trash can and the city putting the bin back. But, the city cannot properly maintain this bin, so it is always overflowing and there are always complaints. The city then solves the problem by removing the bin and the cycle continues. This cycle has happened for two years, until late 2019.
            I should also note that this location looks inefficient to have a trash can, as there is a couple of them one block to the east and one block to the west. The location is also right off the main road, so it will take more effect by the DSNY to empty out the trash can. I think the best thing to do is still have the trash can there, but have the bin be emptied more often. 
            There are many cans on a line going from east to west and would be an easy cleanup for the DSNY. 
        </p>
        <h3> <u> Conclusion  </u></h3>
        <p>
            I believe that adding litter baskets is only part of the solution. The city and the Department of Sanitation needs to collect and empty out the trash before the litter baskets are overflowing. People litter because of the inconvenience of trying to find a place to properly throw out their trash, not because
            of malicious intent. Recently, the city hired workers to pick up trash on the street as a solution to the litter problem, but that is not a preventative solution. The best way is to encourage people to
            properly dispose of their garbage by having more trash bins that are properly maintained.
