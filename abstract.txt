Title: The Effects of Trash Cans on Litter in New York City
Theme: urban planning, litter, trash
Abstract:My focus is analyzing the amount of trash cans throughout the city and how many litter complaints the city receives in each location. I want to see if the two events are correlated and if adding more trash can is a possible solution to the litter problem. Are there areas that require more litter baskets because of the high number of complaints?
Relevance to NYC: I am using data about New York City given by the city government. There has been a big litter problem in the city, which has been worsened because of the pandemic.

This project is about the amount of trash in New York City and looks at the effects of litter baskets on litter. I saw that while most people want a new litter basket in an area, a lot of people also want their existing litter baskets clean out. A combination of both would be a valid solution to littering.
